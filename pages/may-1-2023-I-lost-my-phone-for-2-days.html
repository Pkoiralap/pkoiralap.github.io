            I lost my phone for 2 days.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="separator"> The you can skip it if you want. </div>
            <div class="paragraph"> I am going to keep it simple, or atleast I will try to do so, and fail miserably.</div>
            <div class="paragraph"> Now that you'll know about the level of confidence I am writing this with, let's get started</div>

            <div class="separator"> The plot. </div>
            <div class="paragraph"> I recently lost access to my phone. One faithful day, the heavens decided that I was not worthy enough to be carying the almighty, a tool that is simultaneously the creation of all creations and the destroyer of all destructions, my smartphone. Yes, I know, I will keep the theatrics in check <wink><wink>. Long story short, it broke and here we are, writing (and hopefully reading) this.</div>
            <div class="paragraph"> It was a modern, touchscreen phone. Who even says touchscreen these days? The screen cracked at multiple places, big dents here and there. Either ways, at first, I was not able to make it respond to my fingers, if the touches were performed on it's upper body. Human scale equivalent would be above the neck. That was fine, because I was still able to do most of my phone related work thorough voice commands. Ah! AI you pretty thing. I then lost the ability to make it listen to me. I can't get to above-its-neck and now it doesn't listen to me? Dear phone, are you turning into my wife?</div>

            <div class="separator"> The struggle. </div>
            <div class="paragraph"> So I came with an idea, what if I can touch it above the neck by touching it below the neck? <wink><wink>. So that promted me to start looking for solutions online. And I found this rather unique tool called a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quickcursor&hl=en_IN&pli=1">QuickCursor</a>. Rest assured that they have not paid me anything at all for this writeup. In fact, the app was so custom geared for my usecase, I paid them some dollar amount to help their developers. You paid for an app? Who does that? Netfli...achhuu! excuse me.</div>
            <div class="paragraph"> QuickCursor gave me some solace for a month or so, while I was preparing for the imminent. And then it finally happened...The phone became entirely unresponsive. And no there is no wife reference here.</div>
            <div class="paragraph"> Like any normal human being, since I couldn't make it work, I seeked help. I asked the local UbreakIfix guy if they could solve my problem. I was betting on it being beyond repairs, them betting against me, it was a tense situation, the stakes were high and the cost of repairs, even higher. But I had insurance right? No. I did not. I did not want to pay extra for my phone, it was wrong of them to ask in the first place. After reality has humbled my holy ass though, I still have mixed feelings about insurance, and society, and governance, and politics and what not. </div>

            <div class="separator"> The climax </div>
            <div class="paragraph"> So finally! lost and defeated, I went online and ordered a new one. Although, I do realize that had I known more about this technology that I was toying around and taking grantedly full advantage of, I would have atleast tried to fix it. It's not like I have not replaced a SSD or a RAM, or changed the car's back camera. Just not there yet I guess.</div>
            <div class="paragraph"> While I hate a whole lot of what the modern tech has done, I do love a lot about it. I was able to make an informed, hopefully not-influenced decision about what phone is best in the market, buy it, and it was coming to my doorsteps in 3 days. Now that I am writing and thinking about it, it could have been influenced. Oh, and nevermind what phone I got. The only next thing I want after world war 2 is a what-is-better-android-or-ios war.</div>
            <div class="paragraph"> The phone is on the way, good. However, we do have a problem at hand (literally, lol). I don't have a way to get to the internet anymore. Or do I not? I do have an old laptop that I used to use during my college, but now I am fortunately (or unfortunately) employeed and I don't use that laptop anymore because my work has given me a laptop in which I only work during office hours and then I refrain from using a laptop again at night because of personal and professional reasons. I don't know if you are reading it as fast as I was trying to type it there. So yes, the laptop, then came to my savings and I got access to the internet.</div>
        
            <div class="separator"> The Post-climax clarity </div>
            <div class="paragraph"> Actually, I was just talking until this point and I wasn't saying much. But up next, is what I think the crux of this post is. So as I was on my laptop doing facebook, youtube, cruncyroll, wuxiaworld, and github (I am writing here, aint I?) all together, a sudden realization hit me. I would never do this on my phone. Not even in my wildest dreams. But why? I have the world in my palm. I should be able to do everything. Should be, yes, but is it as easy as doing it on my laptop? Hell no. I have atleast 10 programs running on the background, a few amongts them are chrome, firefox, brave and surprisingly... you guessed it notes. Anticlimatic, I know.</div>
            <div class="paragraph"> So I feel more fulfilling when I on my laptop vs when I am on my phone? Why? Well because in my phone I am either in the facebook app, or the instagram app, or youtube app, or the facebook app, or the youtube app... you get the idea. There are two speculations I have about it. 1. Either the web is dying (or has saturated), majority of the populate is on smartphone apps. Which is being made more and more addictive for them to get out of. or 2. The laptop is indeed a superior device to be on, if you really want to be on the internet. And I believe that neither, either, or both of them can be true.</div>

            <div class="separator"> The you can skip it if you want. Like you didn't with the previous ones </div>
            <div class="paragraph"> So here we are, writing about one of the deepest realization mankind could've had, feeling more productive than ever, after (hopefully not) stating the obvious.</div>
            <div class="paragraph"> Alright. That was it. I need to call it a day, or a next-day. Good night!, morning!. Ahhh! figure it out by yourself.</div>
